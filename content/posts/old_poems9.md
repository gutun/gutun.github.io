**前言**：向过去的探索还没有停止，我发现我还有小时候发的QQ空间。最早从2012年开始，直到最后一次在2019年。2012年的腾讯微博同步QQ空间，我看到我究竟发了些多么尴尬的东西。但是在2014年居然写了一首英文诗，看时间应该是在升高中前的暑假。

**(无题)**  
  
Silently I get up  
With pajamas I look around  
All things seem familiar  
As if it's still yesterday  
  
Dirty clothes are messy on my bed  
Waiting for someone to wash them  
Or they will stay in the bedroom  
Which probably nobody will come to  
  
Leave a note or not?  
I can't decide  
Then I find there's no pen for me  
Also I don't know what to write  
  
Hurry up  
The sky is no longer dark  
Our journey is about to start  
Just throw the useless cards  
  
Hush!Be quiet  
They are still in their dreamland  
Move slowly to the door out there  
And run away quickly ,never stop  
  
Sorry for taking French leave  
The new world is waving his hand  
Though it's not my original intention  
I have to go,I have to  
  
Why?  
I get to feel tense and tired  
I can't walk for my heart is pounding  
Like I can't drop off to sleep last night  
  
They are strict  
They are loving  
They are devils  
They are angles  
  
I am not a lonely guy  
But also not a great man  
I don't know what I want to be  
Seem that I'm always at sea  
  
Silently I go away  
With nothing I just pray  
All things seem familiar  
As if it's still yesterday
